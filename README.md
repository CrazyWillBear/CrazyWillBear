# Hi, I'm Will C 👋

I'm 20 and currently living in Pennsylvania (although I'm originally from the Bay Area). I study Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell University, am a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and am a Bay Area sports fan. One day, I hope to work in the fields of computer and/or data science.
