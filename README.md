# Hi, I'm Will C
I am 19 and currently living in Pennsylvania (although I'm originally from the Bay Area). I study Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell University, am a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and am a fan of baseball, UFC, football, and basketball. One day, I hope to work in the fields of computer and/or data science.
