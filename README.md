# Hi, I'm [Will C](https://www.williamchastain.com) 👋

## About me

I'm 20, studying Computer Science and Engineering at Bucknell University as a brother of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. My interests lie in applied LLM engineering. I'm particularly drawn towards orchestrating LLMs with [langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) *(often in the form of agents and workflows)* and integrating them into larger applications.

## What I'm working on

My current project, [Cogito](https://github.com/CrazyWillBear/research-langgraph), is a philosophy research agent that will later be implemented into a full-scale chat application. My friend [gloggers99](https://github.com/gloggers99) is focusing on the backend in Rust while I focus on the agent/LLM orchestration.
